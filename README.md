A simple app replicating basic functionality for a Pomodoro Timer.

The premise of a Pomodoro Timer is simple - from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique);

"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

The technique has been widely popularized by apps and websites providing timers and instructions. Closely related to concepts such as timeboxing and iterative and incremental development used in software design, the method has been adopted in pair programming contexts."

It aims to be easy and intuitive to use, with few features aiding onboarding of new users.
